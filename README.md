# Bleb's Items
This is a BEE2 package that I originally made for someone else's map but now I'm releasing it to everyone. Here's the items:
## Items
**Respawning Antique Cube:** An Antique Cube that respawns when fizzled. [BUG: It also creates a second one when the player dies] (no dropper)

**70's Hanging Logo:** This is the hanging logo from the 70's seen in the SP campaign.

-----------------------------

And that's it so far. There's much more to come in future versions!
